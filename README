This is the contents of my .vim directory.  It includes my vimrc, which you should symlink to ~/.vimrc in order
to get the goodness.

It includes several plugins: NERDtree, FuzzyFinder, FuzzyFinderTextmate, lots of color schemes, updated ruby bindings, and more.

To use, copy this directory to ~/.vim and symlink ~/.vim/vimrc to ~/.vimrc.

Once you are running, in command mode: 

,d = Toggle NERDtree
,t = FuzzyFinderTextmate
,b = FuzzyBufferFinder
