This is the contents of my .vim directory.  It includes my vimrc, which you should symlink to ~/.vimrc in order
to get the goodness.

It includes several plugins: NERDtree, FuzzyFinder, FuzzyFinderTextmate, lots of color schemes, updated ruby bindings, and more.

To use, copy this directory to ~/.vim and symlink ~/.vim/vimrc to ~/.vimrc.

Once you are running, in command mode: 

,d = Toggle NERDtree
,t = FuzzyFinderTextmate
,b = FuzzyBufferFinder

You can use the install rake task to install this in your home directory. In addition to the plugins above, you'll need Consolas, or change guifont to something else (like Monaco).
